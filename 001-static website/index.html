              <p>President Rodrigo Duterte assumed office on June 30, 2016. In his 2019 State of the Nation address marking the midpoint of his presidency, the first issue he addressed was the persistence of the drug problem, making a connection between “drug money” and the Marawi Siege in 2017 and citing the 175 men in the military and the police killed in the 5-month battle. And the first solution he offered was to “respectfully request Congress to reinstate the death penalty for heinous crimes related to drugs.” This was received with applause in what seems to be the natural progression from the applause also received by his 2018 SONA statement, “Your concern is human rights; my concern is human life.”</p>
              <p>The first human right is the right to life. It has been made clear in the most chilling fashion that those killed had their lives taken because they are not human. In a nation where the justice system barely moves, corpses are automatically perceived as those of the ‘adik.’ Their having been killed is the evidence of the crime that warranted the delivery of justice right on the streets, in ditches, or in their homes. Their being dead is testimony that they, as criminals or drug addicts, are no longer human and therefore worth exterminating. Should a child find herself in the crossfire, she is merely collateral damage in this war.</p>
              <p>Tatlong Taóng Walang Diyos is an exhibition of images that chronicle the three years of Duterte rhetoric conditioning policy and practice. The title is a nod to Mario O’Hara’s 1976 period film set in the three years of the Japanese Occupation, pivoting the full weight of the brutality of the occupation on the body of a woman named Rosario whose narrative, steeped in the sorrowful mysteries, prompts a cruel test of faith in a time seemingly abandoned by an indifferent God.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="panel_b">
              <p>Revisiting this film in late 2016, the film critic Noel Vera uses it as a telescoping lens for what might lie ahead in Duterte’s 6-year presidency. At this 3-year midpoint, this exhibition is an effort to keep in focus the difficult and wearying task of bearing witness carried out by photojournalists who cover the war on drugs. The images selected from the photographers informally grouped as the “Night Crawlers” capture scenes of the killings, fixing within the frames both the killed and the police presiding over homicide cases under investigation [HCUIs that now number in staggering thousands difficult to ascertain because of a lack of competent and credible counting]; and encapsulate moments of grief, loss, and trauma but also of resistance and survival. Some of these photographs have been circulating in a traveling exhibition organized by Rise Up, a network of advocates and families of victims of drug-related killings. Photographs of those killed including minors when they were still alive line shelves in the exhibition to provide portraits of human lives--to retrieve the dignity of the victims before they were summarily killed.</p>
              <p>As visual records of the war on drugs, the graphic images are viewed very differently:</p>
              <ul class="brief-text">
                <li>as powerful indictments against the toll of war, engendering in a steadily growing demographic a renouncement of the killings; or</li>
                <li>as dramatic incitements, engendering in a demographic staunchly loyal to President Duterte a renouncement of these images that are seen as destabilizing the Philippine government.</li>
              </ul>
              <p></p>
            </section>
            <section class="panel_c">
              <p>In addition, photographs of family members holding up photos of the killed compiled by Resbak (a loose organization of photographers, journalists, and artists) throw light on the toll of the war on drugs. For a country that prides itself with the greeting, “Mabuhay!” and a culture that has a predilection for the use of honorific familial titles such as “Kuya” and “Ate,” “Manong,” “Manang,” “Tay,” or “Nay” even for strangers, we have to reckon with the dissonance of the respect and affection these terms suggest with the kind of evisceration of families and communities incurred. The killed and the survivors of the killed are not just alleged drug personalities but mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, sisters, and brothers.</p>
              <p>Video and film, artworks, and a neon piece complement the searing images of the photojournalists. The Night Crawlers, Rise Up, Resbak, Paalam.org, and individual artists and filmmakers have contributed work to this exhibition to defy the seeming apathy, silent resignation, or trumpeted conviction that every single one of these killed did not deserve due process, compassion, justice, or dignity. The Greek philosopher Epicurus observed, “God does not interfere in the affairs of men.” In what can be perceived as a godless time when the most vulnerable demographic of society--first abandoned to their penury then to the aggressive culling within their communities, this exhibition attests to the human spirit and human will to resist impunity, to demand accountability, and to express kinship with victims and survivors of the fatuous war on drugs. Sa tatlong taóng walang Diyos, tayong mga tao ang magbubuklod sa pakikipagkapwa-tao.</p>
